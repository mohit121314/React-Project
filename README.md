Sppech Recognition
This is a speech recognition App built using react javascript and API . It displays whatever we speak as it is on screen wheather it is in english aur hindi . In future we will update this which will include a text field and whatever we will write in it it will speak up that sentence in 8 diffrent languages. We will slowly build an outstanding layout with various text-o-speech features.
